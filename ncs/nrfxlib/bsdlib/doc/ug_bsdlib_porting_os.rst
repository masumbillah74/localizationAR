Porting the BSD library to your OS
##################################

The :ref:`bsdlib` from Nordic Semiconductor is an OS-agnostic C library.
OS-specific parts are moved out of the library.
To use the library with your OS or scheduler, you must first port it by creating a custom :file:`bsd_os.c` file, which serves as an OS abstraction layer.
The library exposes a :file:`bsd_os.h` header file that defines the functions that must be implemented in :file:`bsd_os.c`.
The header file also exposes what functions are provided by the library that the OS integration module must interface with.

The following diagram presents the BSD OS abstraction layer.
Arrows indicate that the elements can communicate with each other directly.

Creating the OS abstraction layer
*********************************

To create a BSD OS abstraction layer, you must implement a number of functions in the :file:`bsd_os.c` file.

bsd_os_init
~~~~~~~~~~~

This function is called by the BSD library when the application has issued ``bsd_init()``.
It is responsible for preparing IRQ for low priority BSD scheduling and trace scheduling.

.. note::
   When working with an application based on Zephyr, set the IRQs to a low priority (6 or 7) and enable them before exiting the function.

The function must also initialize timers and threads (if there is a context that needs a time-out).
If Nordic Proprietary trace is enabled, the medium for where to forward the trace must also be configured in this function.

*Required actions*:

* Initialize timers/threads.
* Configure low priority BSD scheduling IRQ (SoftIRQ).
* Configure low priority trace scheduling IRQ (SoftIRQ).
* Configure medium for trace (UART/SPI etc.).

bsd_os_timedwait
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function is called by the BSD library when a timed context or sleep is required.
A blind return value of 0 will make all BSD library operations always blocking.

*Required actions* to make the operations non-blocking:

* Start counting the time (this can be based on a Timer or Thread for instance).
* Report back the remaining time of the timer if the specific timer is interrupted.
* If timed out, report NRF_ETIMEDOUT.

bsd_os_errno_set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function translates errnoâ€™s from the BSD library to the OS-defined ones.

*Required action*:

* Implement a translation for each errno set by the BSD library.
  If it overlaps with your OS errno, translation is not needed.

bsd_os_application_irq_clear
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function is called by the BSD library when the library wants to clear IRQ on the low priority BSD library scheduling IRQ.

*Required action*:

* Clear the low priority BSD library scheduling IRQ using OS primitives or NVIC functions.

bsd_os_application_irq_set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function is called by the BSD library when the library wants to set a pending IRQ on the low priority BSD library scheduling IRQ.

*Required action*:

* Set a pending IRQ on the low priority BSD library scheduling IRQ using OS primitives or NVIC functions.

bsd_os_trace_irq_clear
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function is called by the BSD library when the library wants to clear IRQ on the low priority trace scheduling IRQ.

*Required action*:

* Clear the low priority trace scheduling IRQ using OS primitives or NVIC functions.

bsd_os_trace_irq_set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function is called by the BSD library when the library wants to set a pending IRQ on the low priority trace scheduling IRQ.

*Required action*:

* Set a pending IRQ on the low priority trace scheduling IRQ using OS primitives or NVIC functions.

bsd_os_trace_put
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function puts the trace string to the desired medium, typically UART.
However, the medium used to forward and store the traces is up to the implementation and must be initialized correctly before used.
If you are not interested in traces, they can be ignored and this function can be empty and simply return.

bsd_os_application_irq_handler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function is implemented in the BSD library and must be called upon the low priority BSD library IRQ handler, triggered by the :cpp:func:`bsd_os_application_irq_set` function.

bsd_os_trace_irq_handler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function is implemented in the BSD library and must be called upon the low priority trace IRQ handler, triggered by the :cpp:func:`bsd_os_trace_irq_set` function.

Other scenarios to handle in bsd_os.c
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. In case the OS has its own IRQ handler scheme, not directly forwarding the IPC_IRQHandler to the BSD library, this must be routed by the OS.
   The OS must call IPC_IRQHandler() upon all IRQs with IRQ number IPC_IRQn.

#. In :file:`bsd_os.c`, you can configure a desired medium for forwarding trace data upon :cpp:func:`bsd_os_trace_put` calls .

Memory
******

The BSD library must have a region of absolute positioned RAM.
The region must be configured as non-secure RAM by the secure application.
The starting address of this region must be 0x20010000, and the size of the block is 0xC020 bytes.

The secure domain memory is divided into segments of 8 KB RAM blocks.
Because the size of the BSD library block is 0xC020 bytes, it is not aligned to full 8 KB blocks.
It occupies six blocks and a small part of a seventh block.

The leftover memory in that seventh block (8160 bytes, starting at address 0x2001 c020) is configured as non-secure, but it can be used by the application.

The following RAM overview diagram shows where in the sequential RAM the BSD library must be positioned, and also indicates the important memory position values. The dotted lines represent 8 KB memory blocks. Note that the BSD library occupies more than six full blocks.

Peripheral requirements
***********************

As the BSD library has been compiled to operate on peripherals in the non-secure domain, the following two peripherals must be configured to be non-secure:

* NRF_IPC
* NRF_POWER

If you are using the hard-float variant of the BSD library, the FPU must be activated in both the secure domain and the non-secure domain, and must be configured to allow the non-secure application to run FPU instructions.

The :file:`nrfx/mdk/system_nrf9160.c` file provides a template on how to configure the FPU in both cases.
The system file also provides several Errata workarounds specific to the chip variant used, which are needed for any secure domain application.


Message sequence diagrams
*************************

The following message sequence diagrams show the interactions between the application, BSD library, and the OS.
